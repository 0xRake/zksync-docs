# zkSync contracts v5.1 upgrade announcement

We will start the notice period to upgrade zkSync contracts to a new version today.

## Added
- `MintNFT`, `WithdrawNFT` operations, which enable native NFT support.
- `Swap` operation, which depending on the implementation may serve either order book or atomic swaps functionality.
- The security council, which is able to shorten the upgrade notice period. More on that
  [here](https://medium.com/matter-labs/keeping-funds-safe-a-3-factor-approach-to-security-in-zksync-2-0-a70b0f53f360).
- `RegeneisMultisig.sol` to handle submissions of the new root hash by the security council during the upgrade.
- A special account with id `2**24 - 1`. It is used to ensure the correctness of the NFT data.

### Changed

- The maximum amount of tokens that can be used to pay transaction fees is increased to 1023.
- The account tree depth for each account increased to `32`.
- Due to the smart contract size limitations, `ZkSync.sol` was split into two parts: the original `ZkSync.sol` and the
  `AdditionalZkSync.sol`, to which some functionality is delegated.
- `ZkSyncNFTFactory.sol` which serves as a default NFT factory, where all the NFTs are withdrawn by default.
