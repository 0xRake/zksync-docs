# Welcome to zkSync

**zkSync** is a user-centric zkRollup platform for DeFi from [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io).

Get started by reading [the overview](/faq/intro.html).

## Project status

 We introduced the [vision for zkSync](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-zk-sync-the-missing-link-to-mass-adoption-of-ethereum-14c9cea83f58) in December 2019. As of today (Jun 3rd 2020):

- [Testnet is live on Rinkeby](https://testnet.zksync.io) â€” give it a try, the UI is simple and intuitive.
- Security audit by [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting/) is [complete](/zksync-1.0-audit.pdf).
- [Zinc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zinc) smart contract framework is under active development.
