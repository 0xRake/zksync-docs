# Welcome to zkSync

**zkSync** is a user-centric zkRollup for DeFi, created by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io). We introduced our [vision for zkSync](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-zk-sync-the-missing-link-to-mass-adoption-of-ethereum-14c9cea83f58) in December 2019.

**zkRollup** is a trustless blockchain scaling technology driven by the power of [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs). A few properties make it unique:

1. **Security guarantees** are strictly as strong as if the funds were placed directly on the mainnet. Not only is the operator completely trustless, there is also no need for fraud-proofs, active monitoring by the user, watch-towers, data-notaries, or any other shacky game-theoretical constructions. 

2. **Usability** is in every aspect as good or better as that of the mainnet. zkRollup supports convenient account model like Ethereum (accounts in zkSync even share addresses with the user's Ethereum accounts). Transaction fees can be paid in any token. Transactions are instantly confirmed with partial (economic) finality. And the coolest thing: withdrawals to the mainnet can be completed in under 5 minutes! This is in stark contrast to Plasma and optimistic rollups, where users must deal with a staggering exit delay of ~1 week.

## Functionality

Today, you can use zkSync** for **ETH and ERC20 token transfers** at high volumes (up to 3500 TPS on Ethereum 1.0) and a negligible cost per transaction. In the near future zkSync will turn into a full-fledged DeFi platform, where you can scale your smart contracts using [Zinc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zinc) programming framework.

In these docs you will find information about the zkSync's functionality, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, zkRollup, differences to other approaches, as well as the [zkSync API developer guide](/dev/).

## Project status

- [Testnet is live on Rinkeby](https://testnet.zksync.io) â€” give it a try, the UI is simple and intuitive.
- Security audit by [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting/) is underway.
- Token transfers on mainnet will be launched as soon as the audits are finished.
- [Zinc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zinc) smart contract framework is under active development.
