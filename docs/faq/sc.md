# Smart contracts

[[toc]]

## Intro

zkSync is on track to bring Turing-complete smart contracts 

## Composability

## Zinc

[Zinc](https://github.com/matter-labs/zinc) is a ramework for SNARK circuits and smart
contracts for the zkSync platform. It includes a simple, safe and efficient Rust-based programming language for defining
zero-knowledge circuits, and a ZKP-friendly runtime execution environment. Zinc is designed to make developing scalable
and privacy-preserving smart contracts easy.

[Get started](https://zinc.zksync.io/).

The testnet for smart contracts on zkSync is live with Curve Finance as the first resident dapp! Check out the
