# Overview

## Introduction

**zkSync** is a a user-centric zkRollup platform for DeFi. In other words, it's a L2 protocol that employs the latest zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography to secure its operations.

## Problems zkSync solves

Gas fees for token transfers on Ethereum [exceed $2M per month](https://ethgasstation.info/). With zkSync these costs can be reduced to a small fraction.

UX-first crypto wallets like [Agrent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/) aim to provide a banking alternative to entire societies. zkSync makes their mission accomplishable.

The rise of DeFi opens many more interesting use cases. zkSync is here to unlock VISA-scale for your project.

## Highlights

- Up to 2000 TPS.
- Security through pure cryptography: no game-theoretic assumptions, no fraud-proofs, no liveness requirement, no watch-towers.
- Same security guarantees as if the funds were kept directly in native L1 accounts.
- Smooth UX: instant tx confirmations, exits to L1 in under 10 min.
- Easy integration: API as simple as Ethereum's web3.js

## zkSync features

- ETH and ERC20 token transfers.
- Cold-wallet friendly account control.
- [Multisig](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/musig-schnorr-sig-scheme/The_MuSig_Schnorr_Signature_Scheme.html) support.
- Permissionless [smart contracts](/faq/sc) (coming soon).
- [Privacy](/faq/privacy) (coming in v2).

## zkSync in comparison

zkRollup stands out remarkably in security and usability among existing L2 scaling solutions. Check out the [L2 comparison guide](https://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955) for more information.
