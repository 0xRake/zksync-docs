# Overview

## Introduction

**zkSync** is a a user-centric zkRollup platform for DeFi. In other words, it's a L2 protocol that employs the latest zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography to secure its operations.

## Problems zkSync solves

Gas fees for token transfers on Ethereum [exceed $2M per month](https://ethgasstation.info/). With zkSync these costs can be reduced to a small fraction.

Reddit recently introduced [Ethereum-based community points](https://www.coindesk.com/reddit-rolls-out-community-points-on-ethereum-to-incentivize-positive-behavior). Enabling them for 330 million Reddit's monthly active users would hit the L1 way harder than Cryptokitty crisis did. zkSync can perfectly handle such load.

UX-first crypto wallets like [Agrent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/) aim to provide a banking alternative to entire societies. zkSync makes their mission accomplishable.

The rise of DeFi opens many more interesting use cases. zkSync is here to unlock VISA-scale for your project.

## Highlights

- Up to 3000 TPS.
- Security through pure cryptography: no game-theoretic assumptions, no fraud-proofs, no liveness requirement, no watch-towers.
- Same security guarantees as if the funds were kept directly in native L1 accounts.
- Smooth UX: instant tx confirmations, exits to L1 in under 5 min.
- Easy integration: API as simple as Ethereum's web3.js

<sup>1</sup> 300 TPS to remain compatible with EVM, otherwise up to 1000 TPS.

<sup>2</sup> The practical upper bound for any rollup on ETH 1.0.

<sup>3</sup>  Only if the attack was successfully detected and fraud-proof reached L1 in time.
