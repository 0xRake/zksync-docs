# Overview

## Introduction

**zkSync** is a a user-centric zkRollup platform for DeFi. In other words, it's a L2 protocol that employs the latest zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography to secure its operations.

## Highlights

- Up 3500 TPS.
- Security through pure cryptography: no game-theoretic assumptions, no fraud-proofs, no liveness requirement, no watch-towers.
- Same security guarantees as if the funds were kept directly in native L1 accounts.
- Smooth UX: instant tx confirmations, exits to L1 in under 5 min.

## zkSync features

- ETH and ERC20 token transfers.
- Cold-wallet friendly account control.
- [Multisig](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/musig-schnorr-sig-scheme/The_MuSig_Schnorr_Signature_Scheme.html) support.
- Permissionless [smart contracts](/faq/sc) (coming soon).
- [Privacy](/faq/privacy) (coming soon).
- Censorship- & frontrunning-resistance (coming soon).
