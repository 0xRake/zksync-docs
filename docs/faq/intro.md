## zkSync in a nutshell

(for general audience)

zkSync is a scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum... take ideas from zkSync intro articles.

Highlights:

- Non-custodial: you are in control at all times
- Trustless (nobody can steal money)
- Scalable: up to 3500 TPS, immune to network congestions
- Cheap: a fraction of cent per tx even in peak times

## How exactly does it work?

(Take all ideas from the lightpaper)

### zkSync vs. Sidechains

- explain sidechain
- explain trust assumptions

### zkSync vs. Plasma

- explain data availability

### zkSync vs. Payment Channels

- briefly explains lightning/payment channels
- explain capital efficiency
- explain max capacity and channel reopenings on chain
- liveness required: 
- explain security problems (payment channels require operators to keep keys online, can be hacked and all funds stolen)
