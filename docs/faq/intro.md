# Overview

## Introduction

**zkSync** is a protocol for scalable crypto payments built on zkRollup technology. It uses zero-knowledge proofs and on-chain data availability to keep user's funds as safe as though they never left the mainnet.

zkSync is a protocol designed with obsession over user and developer experience. The best way to get an impression about it is to [try it out](https://testnet.zksync.io) yourself â€” it will only take 2 minutes!

## Problems zkSync solves

Gas fees for token transfers on Ethereum [exceed $2M per month](https://ethgasstation.info/). With zkSync these costs can be reduced to a small fraction.

UX-first crypto wallets like [Agrent](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Dharma](https://www.dharma.io/) aim to provide a banking alternative to entire societies. zkSync makes their mission accomplishable.

The rise of DeFi opens many more interesting use cases. zkSync is here to unlock Paypal-scale for your project.
