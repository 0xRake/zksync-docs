## Agreed terms

## 1. Acknowledgements

1. Use of the App by you is governed by the terms of this EULA.

1. We may change these terms at any time without notice. Any such changes shall take effect on the next occasion that you make use of the App. Any such new terms may be published in the App.

1. The terms of this EULA apply to the App and to any updates or supplements to the App, unless such additions are provided pursuant to separate terms, in which case those terms shall apply. If any open-source software is included in the App or any Service, the terms of an open-source licence may override some of the terms of this EULA.

1. From time to time updates to the App may be published. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.

1. You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of any mobile telephone or handheld devices that are controlled, but not owned, by you which you may use to access or use the App. You and they may be charged by your and their service providers for internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App on any such Device, whether or not it is owned by you.

1. The terms of our privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) are incorporated into this EULA by reference and apply to your use of the App. You acknowledge and agree that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure.

1. All use of the App is subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy. Continuous, stable, secure provision of the App necessitates our collection of technical information about the Devices and related software, hardware and peripherals to enable us to improve our products and to provide any Services to you.

1. The App or any Service may contain links to other independent third-party websites (“Third-party Sites”). Third-party Sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and do not endorse their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any Third-party Sites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them.
Any words following the terms including, include, in particular or for example or any similar phrase shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the generality of the related general words.

## 2. Service Status

1. The services offered via the App relate to the transferring of digital Tokens facilitated by blockchain technology. The App does not facilitate the storage or sending of fiat currencies.

1. The App and the Services are not regulated by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (the “Autoriteit Financiële Markten” or “AFM”). zkSync Foundation does not hold any authorisations from the AFM. Accordingly, the App should not be used as a substitute for banking services, nor as a substitution for any other form of regulated financial services activity.

## 3. Your Account

1. The security of your Account is your own personal responsibility and zkSync Foundation shall have no liability whatsoever for any failure by you to keep your private keys (or any other security keys or login information) secure and private.

## 4. Scope of service and licence

1. The App enables you to send and receive Tokens (each such event is a “Transaction”). The choice to enter into Transactions is solely your own and you acknowledge that zkSync Foundation does not offer or undertake to verify the identity of any counterparty with which you may interact. You shall have sole responsibility for identifying and verifying the counterparties to Transactions that you elect to enter into, and zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility or liability for any decision by you to send Tokens to any third party.

1. zkSync Foundation shall have no liability to you in the event that you send Tokens to an unintended recipient. zkSync Foundation is unable to ‘cancel’ or ‘undo’ transactions that you enter into using the App and shall have no liability for any Transactions which you enter into mistakenly.

1. Where you attempt to enter into a Transaction, there may be a delay between your initiation of that Transaction and its eventual execution. Such delays may be caused by delays inherent in the functioning of the underlying Token network across which your Transaction will be executed. zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility for any such delays, no matter how such delays may arise.

1. Where you enter into a Transaction in anticipation of receiving goods, assets or services in consideration for Tokens, zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility or liability to you in respect of that consideration. In particular zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility to you for making or facilitating any form of refund or compensatory award to you in the event that your anticipated consideration does not materialise or is of unsatisfactory quality.

1. The App facilitates Transactions of selected Tokens. zkSync Foundation reserves the right to add or remove particular Tokens from the scope of the Services at any time without notice. The fact that any particular variety of Token is (or is not) featured within the scope of the Services should not be interpreted as any form of endorsement of that Token by zkSync Foundation. zkSync Foundation does not recommend or endorse any particular Token for any purpose.

1. Transactions of Tokens rely on the proper functioning of software protocols not owned by zkSync Foundation. The relevant protocols include publicly available open source programs, and zkSync Foundation disclaims all liability for any failure by those protocols to operate as expected or at all. In particular, zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility for any changes to such protocols, or any ‘forking’ of those protocols that result in multiple instances of them existing simultaneously. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for informing yourself about the operation of the relevant software protocols that underpin any Tokens that you choose to use in Transactions, and that you are solely responsible for making yourself aware of any protocol ‘forks’ and taking appropriate action to safeguard yourself from the effects of the same.

1. In consideration of you agreeing to abide by the terms of this EULA, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the App on your Devices, subject to these terms, the Privacy Policy and any applicable Appstore Rules. We reserve all other rights.

## 5. Claims and liability

1. You accept that any transaction, transfer, or contract which you may enter into with any other User or third party shall be a private arrangement between you and that entity. zkSync Foundation shall not be responsible for, nor a party to, such arrangements and the responsibility for settling any disputes arising from the same shall be solely yours. In particular you accept that zkSync Foundation shall have no responsibility for verifying the identity of entities to whom you may transfer Tokens using the functionality of the App.

1. Accordingly, you release zkSync Foundation from all liability for claims, liabilities and losses arising from the type of arrangements described in clause 4.1, and agree that zkSync Foundation shall have no liability for, or in relation to, any dispute which may arise between you and any other user for any reason.

1. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause 4 shall be construed as barring, limiting or otherwise fettering any legal rights that a User may have to commence any form of legal action against any other User or any third party with which they may have entered into any transaction or arrangement involving Tokens.

1. zkSync Foundation is not regulated by the Autoriteit Financiële Markten and does not provide or offer insurance cover to users.

1. Tokens may be ascribed value by third parties (either by way of a cash valuation, or a valuation expressed in other Tokens). zkSync Foundation makes no representations or warranties about any valuation ascribed to Tokens, which depend entirely on the opinions of third parties. Accordingly, zkSync Foundation shall have no liability for any fluctuations in the value of Tokens.

## 6. Events outside our control

1. We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this EULA that is caused by any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including failure of public or private telecommunications networks (each an “Event Outside Our Control”).

## Indemnity

You undertake to indemnify and hold zkSync Foundation harmless in respect of all costs, charges, damages or losses which it may suffer in relation to your use of the App, including in relation to (a) any content which you may upload to the App or any interaction you may have with any other user of the App, (b) any tax implication for which zkSync Foundation may become liable as a result of your use of the App, and (c) any classification of you as an employee of zkSync Foundation (or similar) by any tax authority or employment tribunal.

## Other important terms

1. We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this EULA.

1. You may only transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person if we agree in writing.

1. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

1. Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.

1. Please note that this EULA, its subject matter and its formation, are governed by law of Kingdom of Netherlands. You and we both agree that the courts of Netherlands will have exclusive jurisdiction.

1. The use of this App is lawful in Netherlands. Should you choose to use the App, either as a Provider or Demander, anywhere else in the world you are responsible for checking local law and ensuring your compliance with it.
