## What is zkSync?

(for general audience)

zkSync is a scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum... take ideas from zkSync intro articles.

Highlights:

- Non-custodial: you are in control at all times
- Trustless (nobody can steal money)
- Scalable: up to 3500 TPS, immune to network congestions
- Cheap: a fraction of cent per tx even in peak times

## How does it work?

(for general audience)

high-level tech description
- explain Rollup
- explain zkRollup
- explain where the money is stored
- links to videos (or embed)

## Compared to...

- [...Sidechains](#zksync-vs-sidechains)
- [...Plasma](#zksync-vs-plasma)
- [...Payment channels (Lightning)](#zksync-vs-payment-channels)
- [...Optimistic rollup](#zksync-vs-optimistic-rollup)

(in all comparisons highlight benefitd zkSync)

(all comparisons short)

(Take all ideas from the lightpaper)

### zkSync vs. Sidechains

- explain sidechain
- explain trust assumptions

### zkSync vs. Plasma

- explain data availability

### zkSync vs. Payment channels

- briefly explains lightning/payment channels
- explain capital efficiency
- explain max capacity and channel reopenings on chain
- liveness required: 
- explain security problems (payment channels require operators to keep keys online, can be hacked and all funds stolen)

## Who is operating zkSync?

- The zkSync Dutch foundation ('Stichting ZK Sync') for now
- Multi-validator model with consenus later: why it is important to us (take thoughts from zkSync intro)
    - eventually governed by a permissionless DAO
    - censorship-resistance
    - network resilience
