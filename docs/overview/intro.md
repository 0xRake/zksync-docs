## What is zkSync?

zkSync is a scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum.

Highlights:

- Non-custodial: you are in control at all times
- Trustless (nobody can steal money)
- Scalable: up to 3500 TPS, immune to network congestions
- Cheap: a fraction of cent per tx even in peak times

## How does it work?

- explain zkRollup
- explain where the money is stored
- links to videos (or embed)

## Compared to...

- [...Sidechains](#zksync-vs-sidechains)
- [...Plasma](#zksync-vs-plasma)
- [...Payment channels (Lightning)](#zksync-vs-payment-channels)
