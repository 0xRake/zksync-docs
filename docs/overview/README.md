# Welcome to zkSync

**zkSync** is an Ethereum scaling solution by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io), [the pioneer of zkRollup](https://medium.com/matter-labs/grant-from-the-ethereum-foundation-for-matter-labs-64338f3dd938). We introduced our [vision for zkSync](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-zk-sync-the-missing-link-to-mass-adoption-of-ethereum-14c9cea83f58) in December 2019.

Today, you can use **zkSync** for secure, user-friendly **ETH and ERC20 token transfers** at high volumes (up to 3500 TPS) and a negligable cost per transaction. In the near future, you will be able to scale your Ethereum smart contracts and dapps with [Zinc programming framework](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zinc-update-v0-1-5-open-source-video-from-zksummit-d079dcfd1b15). Later, support for private transactions and smart contracts will be added to zkSync.

In these docs you will find information about the zkSync's functionality, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, zkRollup, differences to other approaches (e.g. Optimistic Rollup), and how to use [zkSync API](/dev/).

## Project status

- [Testnet is live on Rinkeby](https://demo.zksync.dev/explorer/) â€” give it a try, the UI is very simple.
- Security audits by [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting/) are underway.
- The platform will be launched on mainnet as soon as the audits are finished (ETA: end of April 2020).
