## Hey! This is Matter Labs.

We are an engineering team passionate about liberty, blockchain,
math, and beautiful code. Our head
office is [in Berlin](https://www.fullnode.berlin/), but we work from all over the world (mostly Europe).

You might know us as humble creators of [zkSync](https://zksync.io).

### What we're doing

We are scaling Ethereum with [zero-knowledge proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs/). This is [a key technology](https://zksync.io/faq/tech.html#zkrollup-architecture) to enable mainstream adoption of crypto, and our mission is to accelerate this inevitable outcome.

The team consists of world-class experts in [cryptography](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1400.pdf), [hardware](https://medium.com/matter-labs/worlds-first-practical-hardware-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-acceleration-72bf974f8d6e), [compilers](https://zinc.zksync.io/), and [blockchain protocols](https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-v1-1-reddit-edition-recursion-up-to-3-000-tps-subscriptions-and-more-fea668b5b0ff). Our work is [being actively used](https://zkscan.io), and everything is [open source](https://github.com/matter-labs).

### How we work

We stick to a strongly results-only mindest, implemented through autonomy and ownership. To get a deeper peek, check out the Matter Labs'
