## Hey! This is Matter Labs.

We are an engineering team passionate about liberty, blockchain, math, and beautiful code. Our head office is
[in Berlin](https://www.fullnode.berlin/), but we work from all over the world (mostly Europe).

You might know us as humble creators of [zkSync](https://zksync.io).

### What we're doing

We are scaling Ethereum with [zero-knowledge proofs](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs/).
This is
[a key technology](https://medium.com/matter-labs/evaluating-ethereum-l2-scaling-solutions-a-comparison-framework-b6b2f410f955)
to enable mainstream adoption of crypto, and our mission is to accelerate this inevitable outcome of the ongoing digital
revolution.

zkSync is in production since Summer 2020, with [growing usage](https://zkscan.io).

Everything we build is [open source](https://github.com/matter-labs).

### How we work

Matter Labs is a place full of ambitious people: we have tons of freedom but also a very strong results-first mindset.
What matters here is getting things done. We value purposefulness, creativity, directness, minimalism, initiative, and
BS-intolerance.
