# zkSync API v1

The next API interface for the zkSync network is currently in progress and will be released soon.

It will unite both current REST and JSON RPC interfaces under one REST implementation. Once it's released, the support
of old APIs will not be discontinued immediately, and the migration guide will be provided as well.

Stay tuned!
